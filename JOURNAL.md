It was bit difficult but yea i did it
So, the MQ-2 sensor detects smoke or flammable gases. It outputs an analog voltage proportional to the gas concentration, which the Arduino reads via pin A0.
The buzzer sounds an alarm when the gas/smoke concentration crosses a set threshold.
The LED glows as a visual warning when smoke is detected.
  

## 11/1/2025 2 PM - Firmware/Code  

The code is designed for a smoke detection system that uses a smoke sensor, a buzzer, and an RGB LED to indicate air quality levels. The smoke sensor is connected to analog pin A0 while the buzzer and red, green, and blue LEDs are connected to digital pins 8, 9, 10, and 11.
